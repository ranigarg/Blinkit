# BlinkIT Grocery Dataset - MySQL Data Analysis
## This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and deriving insights from a Netflix Dataset using MySQL.

Objectives:* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.*
            * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through statistical analysis and value.*
            * Data Standardization: Renaming columns and ensuring consistency in categorical values.*
            * Performance Optimization: Enhancing database performance with indexing and optimized queries.*
### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about grocery items and their associated outlet details. Key columns include:

- **ItemFatContent**: Fat content of the item (e.g., Low Fat, Regular).
- **ItemIdentifier**: Unique identifier for the grocery item.
- **ItemType**: Category/type of the item (e.g., Dairy, Beverages).
- **OutletEstablishmentYear**: Year the outlet was established.
- **OutletIdentifier**: Unique identifier for the outlet.
- **OutletLocationType**: Location type of the outlet (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2).
- **OutletSize**: Size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, High).
- **OutletType**: Type of the outlet (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery Store).
- **ItemVisibility**: The visibility percentage of the item in the store.
- **ItemWeight**: Weight of the item.
- **TotalSales**: Total sales amount for the item.
- **Rating**: User rating for the item (0-5 scale).

#### Steps to be performed

1. Database and Table Setup : Create a table to store grocery data.
use blinkit;
CREATE TABLE GroceryDataNoPK (
    ItemFatContent VARCHAR(50),
    ItemIdentifier VARCHAR(50),
    ItemType VARCHAR(100),
    OutletEstablishmentYear INT,
    OutletIdentifier VARCHAR(50),
    OutletLocationType VARCHAR(50),
    OutletSize VARCHAR(50),
    OutletType VARCHAR(50),
    ItemVisibility FLOAT,
    ItemWeight FLOAT,
    TotalSales FLOAT,
    Rating FLOAT
);

-- Change the name of table
RENAME TABLE GroceryDataNoPK TO GroceryData;

2. Load Data from CSV File
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/BlinkIT Grocery Data.csv'
INTO TABLE GroceryData
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(ItemFatContent, ItemIdentifier, ItemType, OutletEstablishmentYear, OutletIdentifier, OutletLocationType, OutletSize, OutletType, ItemVisibility, ItemWeight, TotalSales, Rating);

3. Data Validation & Integrity Checks

-- Check Table Structure
Describe Grocerydata;

-- Check Row Counts
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRows FROM GroceryData;

4. Handle Missing Values

-- Find Missing Values
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN ItemFatContent IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ItemFatContent_Null,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ItemWeight IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ItemWeight_Null,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Rating IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Rating_Null
FROM GroceryData;

5. Finding and Removing dublicates

-- Find a dublicates
SELECT *, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
FROM GroceryData
GROUP BY ItemFatContent, ItemIdentifier, ItemType, OutletEstablishmentYear, OutletIdentifier, OutletLocationType, OutletSize, OutletType, ItemVisibility, ItemWeight, TotalSales, Rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Delete Duplicates
-- Create a New Table Without Duplicates
CREATE TABLE GroceryData_Clean AS 
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM GroceryData;

-- Drop the Old Table
DROP TABLE GroceryData;

-- Rename the New Table
ALTER TABLE GroceryData_Clean RENAME TO GroceryData;

-- Verfity delete dublicates
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM GroceryData;

-- Standardize Item Fat Content
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE GroceryData
SET ItemFatContent = 
    CASE 
        WHEN ItemFatContent IN ('low fat', 'LF') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN ItemFatContent = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE ItemFatContent 
    END;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;


âœ… Data is cleaned and standardized
âœ… No missing values in key columns
âœ… Duplicates removed

6. Statistical Analysis of BlinkIT Grocery Dataset
